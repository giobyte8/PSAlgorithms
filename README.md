# Problem-Solving & Algorithms

For learning purposes, this project includes:

1. Implementation of data structures
2. Implementation of classical algorithms
3. Solutions to coding questions from multiple sources

## Data structures

The package `com.giobyte8.psalgo.collections` contains implementations of
several data structures.

As a design purpose, such implementations should be compatible with
implementations from java collections framework so that it can be replaced
without any code changes.

### Data Structures Algorithms

The package `com.giobyte8.psalgo.collections.algorithms` includes
implementations of multiple algorithms that are specific to the
included data structures, such as algorithms to deal with:

- Tree DFS (Depth First Search)
- Tree BFS (Breadth First Search)
